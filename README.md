# PDFIntelliChat
### Overview

The **Interactive PDF-based LLM Chatbot** is a sophisticated tool designed to enhance user interaction with document content through the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). This chatbot allows users to upload PDF files, process the content, store context embeddings, and facilitate an interactive question-and-answer session based on the document's content.

### Features

1. **PDF Upload** 📤:
   - Users can upload PDF files directly through the chatbot interface.
   - The system supports various types of PDF documents, ensuring broad usability.

2. **Content Processing** 🔍:
   - The uploaded PDF content is parsed and processed to extract text.
   - The content is split into manageable sections or paragraphs for efficient embedding and retrieval.

3. **Context Embeddings** 🧠:
   - The extracted content is converted into context embeddings using state-of-the-art embedding models.
   - These embeddings are stored in a database, allowing for quick retrieval and query processing.

4. **Interactive Q&A** ❓:
   - Users can ask questions related to the uploaded PDF content.
   - The chatbot uses the stored context embeddings to understand and provide accurate answers.
   - The system supports resetting the chat to handle new queries or documents seamlessly.

5. **User-friendly Interface** 😊:
   - A simple and intuitive interface ensures that users of all technical levels can easily interact with the chatbot.
   - Real-time feedback and responses enhance the user experience.

### Technical Details

- **Language Model** 🗣️: Utilizes advanced language models such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for understanding and generating responses.
- **Embedding Model** 🧬: Employs modern embedding techniques to create context embeddings for the document content.
- **PDF Processing** 📚: Leverages libraries like PyPDFLoader for efficient PDF parsing and text extraction.
- **Storage** 💾: Uses a scalable database to store and manage context embeddings, ensuring quick access and retrieval during interactions.
- **Environment** 🌐: The project is built using Python, incorporating libraries such as `argparse` for command-line interfaces, and integration with OpenAI's API for language processing.

### Future Enhancements

- **Multi-language Support** 🌍: Expand capabilities to support PDFs in multiple languages.
- **Advanced Search** 🔎: Add the use of using two or more PDFs as context.
- **Integration with Cloud Services** ☁️: Allow seamless integration with cloud storage services for easier PDF uploads.
